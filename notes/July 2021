- you can iterate through objects in javascript using 'for...in' statement

example:
function dump_props(obj, obj_name) {
  let result = '';
  for (let i in obj) {
    result += obj_name + '.' + i + ' = ' + obj[i] + '<br>';
  }
  result += '<hr>';
  return result;
}

For an object car with properties make and model, result would be:

car.make = Ford
car.model = Mustang
