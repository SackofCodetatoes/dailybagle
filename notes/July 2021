- you can iterate through objects in javascript using 'for...in' statement

example:
function dump_props(obj, obj_name) {
  let result = '';
  for (let i in obj) {
    result += obj_name + '.' + i + ' = ' + obj[i] + '<br>';
  }
  result += '<hr>';
  return result;
}

For an object car with properties make and model, result would be:

car.make = Ford
car.model = Mustang

- there are a few ways to go about REST calls through javascript. most of which seems to use a library to handle most of the work as described by this website. some ways include XMLHttpRequest, fetch, Axios, and jQuery. XMLHttpRequest is a deprecated after es6 but was built in to browser. fetch is similar to XMLHttpRequest but uses promises, something you should be familiar with. Axios is a javascript library that similiarly uses promises d handles data in json format. jQuery has multiple methods but would function similar to previously mentioned methods.
